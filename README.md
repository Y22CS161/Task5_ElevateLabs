# AI & ML Internship – Task 5  
## Train-Test Split & Evaluation Metrics (Heart Disease Dataset)

---

## 📌 Task Overview
This repository contains the implementation for **Task 5: Train-Test Split & Evaluation Metrics** as part of the **AI & ML Internship**.

The objective of this task is to understand how to split a dataset into training and testing sets, train a basic machine learning model, and evaluate its performance using standard evaluation metrics.

---

## 📂 Dataset Used
**Heart Disease Dataset**  
- **Source:** Kaggle  
- **File Used:** `heart.csv`

The dataset contains medical attributes such as age, sex, chest pain type, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other clinical parameters.  
The target variable indicates the presence (`1`) or absence (`0`) of heart disease.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Jupyter Notebook  

---

## ⚙️ Task Steps Performed
- Loaded the Heart Disease dataset using Pandas  
- Separated input features and target variable  
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets  
- Trained a Logistic Regression model  
- Predicted outcomes on test data  
- Evaluated the model using:
  - Accuracy  
  - Precision  
  - Recall  
  - Confusion Matrix  

---

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics Explained
- **Accuracy:** Measures overall correctness of predictions  
- **Precision:** Measures correctness of positive predictions  
- **Recall:** Measures the ability to identify actual positive cases  
- **Confusion Matrix:** Summarizes true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives
